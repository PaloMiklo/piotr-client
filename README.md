# Piotr Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.2 and is a client side application to Piotr eshop application.
After a few years, I have decided to rebuild and update the application using the legacy application as a base to build upon.
If you are interested in the project or the code, feel free to contact me at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavol-mikla≈°-2a0b6b174/). I am also open to collaborations.

## Development server

Take a look at the `package.json` file to find the appropriate command for starting a development server. Once the server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser. If you make any changes to the source files, the application will automatically reload.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
